# This is the tutorial for writting a simple hello-world program in java

## By default there will be the main class in java 
> ### In the main class there will be the main method and each main class must have a main method

## For Example:
> public class main {......} here it is a basic syntax of main class, public is access specifier and main is the name of the class
> A java program must have a main method which i.e:
> public static void main(String[]args){.....} here public is access specifier, static means it no objects or initialization of the class is required, void means it has no return type and main is the name of the method

## To print hello-world the syntax is as follows:
>System.out.println("Hello World");
>here System is a Class
>out is instance of Final System Class
println is the instance of PrintStream Class
