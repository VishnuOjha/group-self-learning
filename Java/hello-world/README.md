# This is the tutorial for writting a simple hello-world program in java

## By default there will be the main class in java 
> In the **main class** there will be the **main method** and each main class **must** have a main method

## For Example:
```
public class main{ 
	public static void main(String[]args){ 
		line of code; 
		System.out.println("hello-world");
	} 
}
```

## To print hello-world the syntax is as follows:
> - System.out.println("Hello World");
> - here System is a Class
> - out is instance of Final System Class
> - println is the instance of PrintStream Class
